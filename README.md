# Sensor output prediction using Regression

### Context<br>
The project focuses on DHT22, a Humidity and Temperature sensor so as to analyze and predict the temperature at any point of time. This sensor was used along with Arduino UNO (as a microcontroller) to adjust and configure DHT22.

### Dataset Information <br>
The temperature output of the sensor was constantly recorded over a period of 30 days, with a proper heat source.
